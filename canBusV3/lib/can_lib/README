README for CAN Library
Overview

This repository contains a simple CAN (Controller Area Network) library for ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) based on the ESP-IDF CAN API. The library provides an easy-to-use interface for initializing CAN communication and sending CAN messages using Espressif's ESP32.
Library Files

    can_lib.h: Header file containing the declaration of the CAN library class with functions for initialization and message transmission.
    can_lib.cpp: Implementation file containing the code for the functions declared in can_lib.h.

How to Use

    Clone this repository to your ESP-IDF project directory.

    bash

git clone <repository_url>

Include the library in your project by adding the following line to your source code.

cpp

#include "can_lib.h"

Create an instance of the can_lib class and initialize the CAN interface.

cpp

can_lib myCan;
myCan.can_init();

Send CAN messages using the can_write_msg function.

cpp

    uint32_t id = 0x123;
    uint8_t data[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03};
    uint8_t data_length = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);

    if (myCan.can_write_msg(id, data_length, data) == 0) {
        printf("Message queued for transmission\n");
    } else {
        printf("Failed to queue message for transmission\n");
    }

Customization

    You can customize the CAN pins by providing the desired GPIO numbers when initializing the CAN interface.

    cpp

    myCan.can_init(GPIO_NUM_X, GPIO_NUM_Y);

    Adjust the CAN message parameters, such as identifier, flags, and data, according to your application's requirements.

Example

An example project using this CAN library can be found in the example directory. The example demonstrates how to initialize the CAN interface and send a simple CAN message.
Dependencies

    This library relies on the ESP-IDF CAN API. Ensure that your ESP-IDF version supports the API used in this library.
