# Welcome!

Welcome to the rover documentation repo. You'll find all the documentation inside the [doc folder](doc/).

# How to write new documentation

All the documentation is written in markdown files (.md) for simplicity and portability. You can edit these file in any text editor but markdown editors are nicer. We recommend [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
