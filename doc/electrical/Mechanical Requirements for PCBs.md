These requirements should be considered for the casings, mounting and operation.

- [ ] At least 2 bolt holes which are at least 3.3mm in diameter. There should be a clearance of components of 8mm around the holes to make place for the heat insert. These are used for mounting with M3 bolts.
- [ ] Distance between buttons should be in a grid with intervals of 6mm x 4mm at least.
- [ ] Action component (button, headers, usb connector, LEDs, etc) must be on the same side as the buttons to be seen while working.
- [ ] The RJ45 connector chosen should have the tab on the top (not towards the PCB) unless agreed upon (some PCB orientation may prefer the tab towards the PCB).
- [ ] Preferably put all the tall components on the same side unless its an action component (button, headers, usb connector, LEDs, etc) for simple use.
- [ ] If you have many connectors side to side, put them as close as possible or with a space of at least 3mm.
