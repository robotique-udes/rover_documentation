# General information

This year's competition include the Boneyard Salvage assessment which requieres to investigate coolant lines. We will need to record radioactivity with the provided geiger counter and determin if there are any ozone and/or hydrogen leaks in the area. Therefore, we will need sensors to detect a change in ozone and hydrogen concentration compared to our baseline which will be uncontaminated air. Thus, a calibration will be needed before the task and a threshold needs to be established in advance.


## Ozone
Ozone is a dense gaz molecule. It is present in small quantities in the air (around 10-20 ppb) and will be present at less than 0.1 ppm (100ppb) in the competition's leak. Thus, we could put a threshold around 40-50ppb. It can be detected with an ozone sensor placed over the leak.

ATTENTION
Ozone (O3) is highly reactive and oxydative so it would be prudent to be carefull around the electrical parts and avoid prolonged exposition or cover the parts that might react. Otherwise, it shouldn't interfere with the rover and there aren't any risks worth noting. People should know that ozone is an asphyxiant and breathing it in big quantities isn't safe. However, the concentrations present at the competition and for testing should be harmless.
