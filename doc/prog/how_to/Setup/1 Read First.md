# Introduction

This folder will help you setup your computer for development. Follow each section in order, keep in mind that installing the OS and ROS can take quite some time, watching a series on the side is recommended.

1. [Ubuntu Installation](Ubuntu%20setup)
2. [[bashrc file]]
3. [[ROS Setup]]
4. [[Git Setup]]

Once your done, check the tools setup list in [the tools folder](../Tools)
